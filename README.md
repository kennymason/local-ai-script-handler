# local-ai-script-handler
Creates a simple menu bar item on macOS that handles startup and shutdown for Open WebUI.

There are two simple options in the dropdown: Run, and Quit.

## Run
"Run" will run a bash script to start up the docker container for Open WebUI. It then opens the UI in browser when it finishes launching.

## Quit
"Quit" will run the bash script to stop the running docker container.
